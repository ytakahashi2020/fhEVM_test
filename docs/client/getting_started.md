# Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation for fhevmjs, a JavaScript library that enables interaction with blockchain using Zama's technology! This comprehensive guide provides developers with detailed information on encryption of data using TFHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Torus) and generation of EIP-719 tokens for reencrypt data.

## Installation

To get started with fhevmjs, you need to install it as a dependency in your JavaScript project. You can do this using npm, Yarn or pnpm. Open your terminal and navigate to your project's directory, then run one of the following commands:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install fhevmjs

# Using Yarn
yarn add fhevmjs

# Using pnpm
pnpm add fhevmjs
```

This will download and install the fhevmjs library and its dependencies into your project.
